# FullStack Student database system
In this project I worked with several tools, I learned how to do API calls from React app to the DB, work with postman and MySQL database also I should mention ReactJS with MUI library for frontend and Java SpringBoot for backend. I also touched tools like Apache and Maven, a lot of knowledge in this project & starting to work on my portfolio and will put it there.
For FrontEnd I used Visual Studio Code IDE and for BackEnd Intellij idea.
